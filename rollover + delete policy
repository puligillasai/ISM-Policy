letâ€™s design a combined rollover + retention ISM policy for your 3 index types.

ðŸ”¹ How It Works (Flow)

New index starts in hot state.

Once it reaches 50GB OR 7 days, ISM rolls over â†’ creates a new index and moves writes there.

The old index just sits there (read-only).

After the old index is 30 days old, ISM transitions it to delete state â†’ logs are deleted.
